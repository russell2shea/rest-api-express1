#### Notes

REST API is different from a traditional serverside application because it responds to requests with data such as JSON; a traditional serverside application responds to requests with HTML. REST is less flexible than GraphQL which can more flexible and eliminate over and underfetching.  

Client: application requesting info

REST = Representational State Transfer. How the server should respond to the request of a client. 

Example github api. 

REST API's us HTTP methods; GET POST PUT DELETE. As opposed to the more traditional CRUD. 

API nouns are usually used to define resouces. For example; movies.
